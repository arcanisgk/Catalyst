/**************************************************************************************
 * Request Throttling Middleware
 *
 * This middleware implements rate limiting functionality to protect the application
 * from excessive requests. It can be used to prevent abuse, API flooding, and
 * denial-of-service attacks by limiting the number of requests a client can make
 * within a defined time period.
 *
 * In the current implementation, the middleware only logs request information without
 * enforcing actual rate limits. In a production environment, this would be extended to:
 *
 * - Track request counts per client IP or authentication token
 * - Define rate limit windows (e.g., X requests per minute/hour)
 * - Return 429 Too Many Requests responses when limits are exceeded
 * - Include rate limit headers in responses (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, etc.)
 *
 * Usage:
 * This middleware can be applied globally to all routes or selectively to
 * specific routes that require protection.
 *
