Catalyst PHP Framework

### Overview

The Catalyst PHP Framework appears to be a relatively new PHP framework (copyright 2023-2024) developed by Walter
Nu√±ez (arcanisgk). It requires PHP 8.3 and is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

### Architecture & Structure

- Modern PHP Usage: The framework leverages PHP 8.3 features like the match expression for control flow.
- Entry Points: Clear separation between web (public/index.php) and CLI (public/cli.php) entry points.
- Directory Structure: Follows a conventional structure with app, public, and vendor directories.
- Constants System: Extensive use of constants for configuration and environment detection:
    - Path constants (PD, WD, DS)
    - Request information (RQ, UR)
    - Environment detection (IS_CLI)
    - Time management (CT)

### Features

- Logging System: Includes a structured logger with different styling for various log levels (ERROR, WARNING, INFO,
  etc.).
- CLI Support: Dedicated CLI support with a runner that uses custom PHP configuration.
- Environment Detection: Automatic detection of CLI vs web environment.
- Visual Output: Uses a DrawBox component for formatted console output.

### Development Status

The framework appears to be in active development with foundational components in place:

- Core constants and environment detection
- Basic logging functionality
- Entry point structure

However, based on the snippets provided, some components might be missing or incomplete:

- The foo() function call in the index.php suggests it might be a placeholder
- The Logger.php file has an incomplete method for getting the current user ID

### Next Steps

For further development, the framework would likely benefit from:

- Complete routing system
- Database abstraction layer
- Request/response handling
- View rendering
- Authentication system
- Documentation

Overall, Catalyst shows promise as a lightweight PHP framework with modern design principles, but appears to be in an
early stage of development.
